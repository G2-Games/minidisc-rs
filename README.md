# Rust Minidisc
A library for controlling and interfacing with [MiniDisc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiniDisc) devices from within Rust programs. Compatible with many cross platform targets (including Web Assembly!) by using [cross-usb](https://github.com/G2-Games/cross-usb).

The feature set is very similar to that of [netmd-js](https://github.com/cybercase/netmd-js) which this library is inspired by. For more information check out the absolutely awesome [Web Minidisc project](https://github.com/asivery/webminidisc), [NetMD-exploits](https://github.com/asivery/netmd-exploits), and the C based [Linux Minidisc project](https://github.com/linux-minidisc/linux-minidisc).
